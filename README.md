# Markov
Build a generative text model using Markov processes by implementing WordGram and HashMarkov classes. WordGram represents immutable word sequences; HashMarkov leverages HashMap for efficient text generation. Test each class with JUnit and compare HashMarkov performance to BaseMarkov in generating coherent, randomized text.
